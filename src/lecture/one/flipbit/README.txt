        The following method converts number to binary string, then
        divides that string into 3 pieces :
        - binary sequence before flipping bit
        - flipping bit
        - binary sequence after flipping bit
        Then flipped bit changes its value from 0 to 1 and vice versa
        After that string combines and gets parsed as integer
